"""Skill loader for CLI commands.

This module provides filesystem-based skill loading for CLI operations (list, create, info).
It wraps the prebuilt middleware functionality from the deepanalysts library and adapts
it for direct filesystem access needed by CLI commands.

For middleware usage within agents, use deepanalysts.middleware.skills.SkillsMiddleware directly.
