DeepAlpha CLI is an AI-powered trading assistant that runs in your terminal. It combines a multi-agent orchestration system (Deep Analysts) with trading tools, autonomous background agents (Spawns), and BYOK model support to help you analyze markets and manage positions.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Supervisor delegates to specialized subagents for technical analysis and fundamental research.
- **Deep Market Integration**: Candles, technical indicators, charts, news, fundamentals, and economics calendar.
- **Signal Management**: Create, update, close, and cancel trading signals with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approval.
- **Autonomous Spawns**: Background agents that monitor positions or run scheduled tasks using your own API keys (BYOK).
- **BYOK Model Support**: Bring your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google API key. Switch models at runtime with `/model`.
- **Memory & Skills**: Persistent agent memory and reusable skill workflows.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv sync                 # Install dependencies
uv run deepalpha login    # Authenticate via browser OAuth
uv run deepalpha          # Launch interactive TUI
```

### CLI Options

```bash
uv run deepalpha -m "Analyze BTC/USDT"     # Auto-submit a prompt
uv run deepalpha -r                         # Resume most recent thread
uv run deepalpha -r <thread_id>             # Resume specific thread
uv run deepalpha --model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929  # Override model
uv run deepalpha --auto-approve             # Skip HITL confirmations
uv run deepalpha --pipe -m "..."            # Non-interactive, stream to stdout
uv run deepalpha --sandbox modal            # Remote sandbox execution
```

### Management Commands

```bash
uv run deepalpha status                     # Auth status
uv run deepalpha logout                     # Clear credentials
uv run deepalpha list                       # List agents
uv run deepalpha threads list               # List conversation threads
uv run deepalpha threads delete <id>        # Delete a thread
uv run deepalpha spawns list                # List local spawns
uv run deepalpha skills                     # List installed skills
```

### Interactive Commands

`/help`, `/clear`, `/remember`, `/tokens`, `/threads`, `/model`, `/spawns`, `/quit`

## Architecture

### Deep Analysts

Supervisor-subagent architecture with middleware stack for memory, skills, summarization, and HITL approval.

```
Supervisor (Orchestrator)
├── Technical Analyst — multi-timeframe chart analysis (1d, 1h, 15m)
└── Fundamental Analyst — news, financials, economics calendar

Signal management, position closing, spawn creation — handled by supervisor directly (with HITL).
```

### Local Spawns (BYOK)

Autonomous background agents that run locally using your own API keys. Created via the agent ("monitor this position") or programmatically.

- **Monitoring** spawns watch positions: SL/TP breach detection, thesis validation, trailing stops.
- **Task** spawns run scheduled work: pattern scanning, daily summaries, research.
- Schedule types: `once`, `interval` (minutes), `cron` (5-field expression).
- Max 3 concurrent, 5-minute timeout, exponential backoff on errors.

The CLI must be running for spawns to execute. When closed, spawns pause until next launch.
